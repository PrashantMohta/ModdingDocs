# ModMenu

## Introduction

Starting with Hollow Knight 1.5.x.x, the Modding API added the ability for mods to add a menu to the "Mods" menu in game.This is a standard and preferred way to add GUI options to configure your mod's settings. The Modding API has 2 ways to create a Modmenu, either by implementing the `IMenuMod` interface or the `ICustomMenuMod` interface.

## IMenuMod

`IMenuMod` allows you to add a list of horizontal selections, that allow you to choose 1 option each from a list. This is a common and versatile element used across HK menus for configurations. IMenuMod is really simple to implement but it is limited in what it can do.

## ICustomMenuMod

`ICustomMenuMod` allows you to add a bunch of different menu elements. It is more complex to implement, but offers a lot more flexibility than IMenuMod.

## Satchel.BetterMenus

`Satchel.BetterMenus` is built to allow mods to implement `ICustomMenuMod` functionality while offering the simplicity of IMenuMods.
It also makes a bunch of commonly desired features like updating the menu dynamically, showing/hiding elements simple to use.
